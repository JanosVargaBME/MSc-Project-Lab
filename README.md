## Sprint based Task manager

### Specification

My main goal is to create a Task manager to handle sprints for a company.

The company's admin can manage Projects (CRUD functions) and set Project admins for each project. The projects can be viewed in an overview table.

Each project uses sprint as a unit of time management. Project admins can manage the sprint's data (length, start/end date, developers) on an admin page.

For every sprint, the developers can add Work items to handle the project development. The work items are arranged hierarchically:
> EPIC

> ---- Feature

> ------------ User Story

> ----------------------- Task

> ----------------------- Bug

Each Work item has a:
- Title
- Description
- State: New/Active/Resolved/Closed
- Log data(eg.: estimated/remaining hours)
- Branch name
- PR link
- Parent item
